            <p class="mb-5 desc-font text-left">The negative impacts of global climate change are becoming increasingly apparent around the world. These impacts disproportionately affect people who have contributed the least to causing the problem, particularly people in developing countries (also known as the Global South). Climate change is also inherently linked to racial inequality and colonialism through historical and ongoing extraction of natural resources and wealth from the Global South to sustain economic development in the industrialised countries of the Global North. Racial inequality in cause and vulnerability is not limited to the disparities between countries of the global North and South.</p>

UK people of colour have unique and different perspectives on climate change causes and solutions for their local communities. They also have unique perspectives of being connected to international communities affected first and worst by climate change.</p>

            <p>When respondents described their experiences of climate change vulnerability, their accounts often included links to impacts in other countries that disproportionately experience climate change impacts like droughts, floods, severe heat, cyclones and the resulting health, social, economic and cultural harms suffered by friends and relatives. This suggests that people of colour may feel a strong affinity with dialogues around international climate finance and support for vulnerable countries. Heat, in particular, is a widely connective experience, with respondents relating strongly to heatwaves in the UK and in countries abroad with which they have heritage links.</p>
